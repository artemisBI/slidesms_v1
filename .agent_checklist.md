# Agent Workflow Checklist

This file ensures consistency across all development sessions. **Every agent should review this file at the start of each session.**
---
## 💡 Agent-User Instructions

- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
- **Show, don't tell**: Use screenshots/recordings in walkthroughs
- **Keep it simple**: Start with MVP, iterate later
- **Explain simple**: Use real world analogies + hierarchies
- **Document decisions**: Explain *why* in comments and logs
- **Be conversational**: Ask questions to understand user's vision better

---

## 🤔 Ask More Questions

**When to ask clarifying questions:**
- User's request is vague or could be interpreted multiple ways
- Multiple valid approaches exist (ask for preference)
- Design decisions that affect user experience
- Technical trade-offs (performance vs. simplicity)
- User forgets to provide complete context

**Example questions to ask:**
- "Would you prefer [Option A] or [Option B]?"
- "Should this section be on a light or dark background?"
- "Do you want this animation to be subtle or more prominent?"
- "Is this feature critical for MVP, or can we add it later?"

## 🎨 When Building Frontend/UI

- [ ] **Reference `branding_package.md`** for:
  - Color palette
  - Typography
  - Logo usage
  - Brand voice
- [ ] **Follow design principles**:
  - **Readability first**: High contrast, light backgrounds for text-heavy sections
  - Modern, premium aesthetics
  - Micro-animations for engagement
  - Mobile-responsive
  - Generous white space

---

## 🔐 Security & Environment

- [ ] **Never commit secrets**: Use `.env.local` for sensitive data
- [ ] **Check `.gitignore`**: Ensure `.env*` is excluded
- [ ] **Update `service_inventory.md`**: Document any new services or APIs


## 🐛 Debugging Visual Issues

When the user reports a visual problem (e.g., "text is hard to read", "colors are wrong"):

**Best approach:**
1. **Ask for specifics**: "Which section?" or "Can you share a screenshot?"
2. **Request CSS class**: "Can you inspect the element and share the class name?"
3. **Use diagnostic mode**: Temporarily change the background to white/transparent to isolate the issue

**Example user feedback that works well:**
> "The Features section (2nd section, 'Why SlideSMS?') has white text on a dark background that's hard to read. Chrome DevTools shows `.features` has `background: #0A0A0F`. Can you lighten this?"

**What to avoid:**
- Guessing which element is causing the issue
- Making multiple changes at once (hard to diagnose)
- Not asking for clarification when the issue is vague

## 📦 Animation Libraries

**Installed:**
- `framer-motion` - Scroll animations, text reveals
- `lucide-react` - Monochromatic icons
- `react-particles` + `tsparticles-slim` - Particle backgrounds

**Usage:**
- Scroll-triggered animations: `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`
- Icon animations: `whileHover` with spring transitions
- Particle backgrounds: Configure in `BackgroundParticles.tsx`
